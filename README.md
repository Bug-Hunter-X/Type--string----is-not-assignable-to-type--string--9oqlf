This code demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where you try to pass an array of strings to a function that expects a single string. The error message is clear and states the problem. The solution is to either change the function signature to accept an array or modify the code to pass a single string to the function. This example highlights the importance of type checking and how it can help catch errors early in the development process.
